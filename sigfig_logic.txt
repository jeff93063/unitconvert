if source value is zero
	if destination value is zero
		just display zero
	if destination value is non-zero * ONLY FOR TEMP
		show 3 sigfigs
if source has a decimal
	if source absolute value is < 1
		sigfigs start at first non-zero after the decimal
		sigfigs end at end of string
	if source absolute value is > 1
		sigfigs start at first non-zero before the decimal
		sigfigs end at end of string
if source has no decimal
	sigfigs start at first non-zero
	if destination has a decimal
		source sigfigs end at last non-zero
	if destination has no decimal
		destination sigfigs are "at least" all available integers

need to know
